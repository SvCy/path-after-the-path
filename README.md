# path-after-the-path
[BatchScript] Starting from a selected directory, let's user to a path without navigating through other directories or decoys, like a path password.
Open Dir/ Path after the path. (Daniel Thrasher: sketch after the sketch)

og: opens the path/file after the dir. closes, done :) <br>
v2: loops back in typo. issues:closes on space enter, doesn't close if not incld file extension.+
v2.1: additional variable to reduce future dir change edits.
v2.5: fixed not including file extension not closing cmd.
v2.6: fixed empty enter trying the last path, which is likely an invalid path in our case here. now directly opens the root/work dir (dir0) on empty enter.
v2.7: fixed not closing after opening root dir on empty enter.
v2.8: fixed inserting only space/s closes the script with an error.

Remaining issue/s:
??
